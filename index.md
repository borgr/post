<!-- # Ways to sieve through new papers and look for related ones -->

Some of us were happy in our safe place, doing our research for years. Then suddenly, we need to uproot ourselves, and no one tells us how.
This guide covers all of [my](https://ktilana.wixsite.com/leshem-choshen) findings before eventually going for my post in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (Computer Science). Why do I matter in all that? because postdocs are very individual and fields and countries may alter some of the suggestions.

You must be thinking there are so many better guides out there, I hope you are right. can you share them or add here the best tips you found? Let's make it great for us all.

## Who to Talk to
- Consider your future career, this decision would likely affect your few next years -- talk to **someone doing it**
- You would want a position -- talk to someone who **just got the position **
Ask them what were they asked about, what were people interested impressed etc.
- Also ask the ones deciding on such positions, those are usually **senior researchers**
Remember, you are no longer one of the thousands doing a BA, they are not flooded with requests for help and most decent people would gladly give you a hand. Moreover, it might even be an opportunity for you to get known, to tell them of your plans so they will have you in mind. Last, we are still irrational machines, asking for help, paradoxically, makes you closer and might help when you ask for help next time, and you might need their help applying when you get back.

## What to Look for
It boils down to 3 questions: 
What allows the best research during my post?  
What do I need to **get** the **job** I want after the post (I assume here, academic or PI in an institute)?  
What would help me **after** I get this job?  

Notes:
1. Yes, there are many reasons, many, not to get the post that maximizes all of the above, but I can't tell you where your wife would be happiest or where they offer more money. Definitely start with what would make you (and everyone coming with you!) happy and in this space looks to maximize the other things.
1. You will never get everything, but each checkmark here would be an advantage.
### Good for Research
This is a very individualistic choice, but (arguably?) the most important one, so take the other choices with grain and salt.
One interesting and repeating piece of advice for many reasons is to look for a "hub". Consider who else is around, eventually, you might collaborate with more than your supervisor, you might learn, might or influence more with more people around and importantly, if something happens with your host, will the postdoc be considered a failure? In a hub, you will just collaborate with others instead.
### Academic Job Checklist
You don't need all of those, but those are advantages that might be good to tick
- First your research impact (citations, venues etc.), some teaching experience also a bonus  
- A good recommendation letter from someone senior (tenure+ known in the field)  
- A known institute (yes, some would appreciate the university, regardless of the advisor)  
- Proof of making a large investment in research, "living it, living for it" (e.g., moving abroad and being immersed in research)  
- Proof of diverse abilities, one trick ponies are a risk, maybe they won't be able to replicate their success in the future  
- Research Agenda, at least one thread of research a relatable direction you might keep pursuing and they see how it complements the faculty  
- Researcher on your own, were all your research piggy-back? All with the mark of your advisor or two? Can you collaborate with others? Lead or only join a running project etc.  
- Proof of excellence (Especially Grants and Scholarships which you will apply to more as a Prof.)  

### Post's Affect Post Being Hired
As a professor, you would apply for (non-anonymous) grants of all sorts. The committee members would not be necessarily from your sub-field or even from your field, depending on who are you competing against, and you probably have less advantage as you compete against more. So the committee members would not know your supervisor, and they might not know if your research is impressive, they would know how many citations you had, and that you have been in Stanford. So for this, location is much more important than the supervisor's name.
## Time

## Writing Emails

## You Need to Decide
Postdocs vary a bit more than a degree. Still, there are 3 main types of postdocs and you should choose which one(s) suits you.  
**Extended PhD** -- You are a senior researcher, keep doing your research.  
**Grant based** -- The funding for the post comes from a large project, it has the advantage of security, being able to advise and lead a large project, but the disadvantage is that it comes with less freedom, at least a major part of your time should be dedicated for this project.  
**Advise** -- Mostly in large labs, postdocs act as the ones leading research and advising, it offers a lot of freedom and little help or intervention from above. Remember you are still expected to publish at least a bit as a first author.  

## Money
Apply early for Scholarships, it is worth for the prestige, maybe money. If you got one, it might be worth revisiting the places you wanted to go to and couldn't or didn't answer, maybe with the funds (even partial ones) it might be easier to open a position and acquire the rest of the funds (matching).
Look for fellowship related to your background (e.g., women's), to the place you are looking for (e.g., Fullbright if you got to the US), and also to places you consider going to (many universities or institutions have fellowships (e.g., NYU center of data science).
## Industry
Some areas may have real postdocs with institutes or companies. Those might or might not be holding prestige, check. Usually, they would pay better. Apart from that, make sure what kind of postdoc are you expected to do there. Is it really focused on research (nothing else would count)? Would you be able to fill the checklist (e.g., get a meaningful letter from someone appreciated in academia)?

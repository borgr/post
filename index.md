<!-- # Ways to sieve through new papers and look for related ones -->

Some of us were happy in our safe place, doing our research for years. Then suddenly, we need to uproot ourselves, and no one tells us how.
This guide covers all of [my](https://ktilana.wixsite.com/leshem-choshen) findings before eventually going for my post in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (Computer Science). Why do I matter in all that? because postdocs are very individual and also have 
## Who to talk to

## What to look for
It boils down to 3 questions.  
What allows the best research during my post?
What do I need to **get** the **job** I want after the post (I assume here, academic or PI in an institute)?
What would help me **after** I get this job?
Note: yes, there are many reasons, many, not to get the post that maximizes all of the above, but I can't tell you where your wife would be happiest or where they offer more money.

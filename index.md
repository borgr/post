<!-- # Ways to sieve through new papers and look for related ones -->

Some of us were happy in our safe place, doing our research for years. Then suddenly, we need to uproot ourselves, and no one tells us how.
This guide covers all of [my](https://ktilana.wixsite.com/leshem-choshen) findings before eventually going for my post in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (Computer Science). Why do I matter in all that? because postdocs are very individual and also have 

You must be thinking there are so many better guides out there, I hope you are right, can you share them or add here the best tips you found? Let's make it great for us all.

## Who to Talk to
- Consider your future career, this decision would likely affect your few next years -- talk to **someone doing it**
- You would want a position -- talk to someone who **just got the position **
Ask them what were they asked about, what were people interested impressed etc.
- Also ask the ones deciding on such positions, those are usually **senior researchers**
Remember, you are no longer one of the thousands doing a BA, they are not flooded with requests for help and most decent people would gladly give you a hand. Moreover, it might even be an opportunity for you to get known, to tell them of your plans so they will have you in mind. Last, we are still irrational machines, asking for help, paradoxically, makes you closer and might help when you ask for help next time, and you might need their help applying when you get back.

## What to Look for
It boils down to 3 questions: 
What allows the best research during my post?  
What do I need to **get** the **job** I want after the post (I assume here, academic or PI in an institute)?  
What would help me **after** I get this job?  

Notes:
1. Yes, there are many reasons, many, not to get the post that maximizes all of the above, but I can't tell you where your wife would be happiest or where they offer more money. Definitely start with what would make you (and everyone coming with you!) happy and in this space looks to maximize the other things.
1. You will never get everything, but each checkmark here would be an advantage.
### Good for Research

### Academic Job Checklist

### Post's Affect Post Being Hired
As a professor, you would apply for (non-anonymous) grants of all sorts. The committee members would not be necessarily from your sub-field or even from your field, depending on who are you competing against, and you probably have less advantage as you compete against more. So the committee members would not know your supervisor, and they might not know if your research is impressive, they would know how many citations you had, and that you have been in Stanford. So for this, location is much more important than the supervisor's name.
